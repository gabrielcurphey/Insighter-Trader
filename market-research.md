## Market Opportunity

### The Numbers Look Good

- **55% of prospective new investors** are Gen Z and Millennials (YouGov 2025)
- **Gen Z has $360 billion** in spending power
- **Gen Z started investing at age 20** on average (vs. 31 for Boomers)

3. **Complex interfaces** - Most platforms are built for advanced traders
4. **Mental fatigue** - Overwhelming apps cause poor decisions and impulsive trading

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors (Trading + Analytics)

| Platform | Strength | Weakness for Beginners |
|----------|----------|------------------------|
| **Robinhood** | Simple UI, commission-free | Limited analytics, reputation issues (GameStop) |
| **Webull** | Advanced analytics | Overwhelming for beginners |
| **TradingView** | Best charting, huge community | Complex, paid tiers needed |
| **Moomoo** | Free Level II data | Too many features |
| **Public** | Social features, simple | Limited analytics |

### Analytics-Only Tools

| Tool | Strength | Weakness |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Yahoo Finance** | Free, accessible | Basic, not modern UX |
| **FINVIZ** | Great screeners | Steep learning curve |
| **Koyfin** | Pro-level analysis | Designed for professionals |
| **Seeking Alpha** | Good research | Subscription-heavy |

### AI-Powered New Entrants

## Gap Analysis: Where You Could Win

### The Opportunity
Most tools fall into two camps:
1. **Too simple** (Robinhood) - Easy but no real analytics
2. **Too complex** (TradingView, Webull) - Powerful but overwhelming

**There's room for a middle ground:** Meaningful analytics presented simply.

### Potential Differentiators

1. **Radical simplicity** - Show only what matters, hide complexity
2. **Guided experience** - Tell users what to look at, not everything at once
3. **Mobile-first design** - Gen Z lives on phones
4. **Educational integration** - Teach while showing data
5. **No trading execution** - Pure analytics avoids regulatory complexity

---

## Honest Assessment

### Reasons This Could Work

- Clear market demand (young investors growing rapidly)
- Real pain point (information overload is documented)
- Differentiation is achievable (UX focus)
- Organic marketing fits the audience (Gen Z shares on social)
- Analytics-only avoids broker licensing complexity

### Serious Challenges

1. **Technical barrier** - Building this requires significant development skills you don't have yet
2. **Data costs** - Real-time market data is expensive ($$$)
3. **Crowded market** - Many well-funded competitors
4. **Monetization** - Free tools struggle; subscriptions are hard to sell to young users
5. **Retention** - Trading apps have high churn

### Questions to Explore

- Would you learn to code, hire developers, or use no-code tools?
- Analytics-only or also enable trading?
- Web app, mobile app, or both?
- Free with ads? Freemium? Subscription?
- What specific analytics would you simplify?
